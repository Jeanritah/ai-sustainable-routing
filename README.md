## Project Topic
Design of Sustainable Cities through Digital Twins and Optimal Routing for Citizens

## Description
This project explores heat-aware routing for pedestrians or cyclists using
urban digital twin data from the TALEA project. We aim to compute routes that
minimize heat exposure and maximize thermal comfort using Urban Heat Exposure
Index (UHEI), NDVI, and green infrastructure data.

## Data Sources
- TALEA Green Cells
- OpenStreetMap
- Urban Heat Exposure Index (UHEI)

## Methods
- Graph-based routing
- Dijkstra / A* with custom cost functions
- Optional multi-objective optimization

## Status
Project setup in progress.
