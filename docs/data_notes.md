## TALEA Processed Data

Source: TALEA_Green_Cells / dataset / processed_data

Files used:
- uhei_grid.geojson: 100x100m grid with Urban Heat Exposure Index (UHEI)
- ndvi_grid.geojson: 100x100m grid with NDVI (vegetation index)

These datasets are reused from previous TALEA work and mapped onto
OpenStreetMap road segments to compute heat-aware routes.
